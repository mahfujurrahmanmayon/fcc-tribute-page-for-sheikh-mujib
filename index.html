          Here's a time line of Sheikh Mujibur rahman's life
        </h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1920 </strong> - Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was born in the
            village of Tungipara under the then Gopalganj Subdivision (now
            District) of the then Faridpur District on March 17, 1920. His
            father Sheikh Lutfar Rahman and his mother Sheikh Sayera Khatun had
            four daughters and two sons. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was their third
            child. His parents used to adoringly call him "Khoka".
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1927 </strong> - At the age of seven in 1927, Sheikh Mujib
            began his schooling at Gimadanga Primary School. At nine, he was
            admitted to class three at Gopalgonj Public School. Subsequently, he
            was admitted to Gopalgonj Missionary School. Before becoming active
            in student movements and politics, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had an
            affinity toward sports like any other teenager. He possessed a
            special love for football. A talented football player, Sheikh
            Mujibur Rahman spent his adolescent years playing in competitive
            tournaments, where he received awards for his outstanding
            performances.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1932/33</strong> - Sheikh Mujibur Rahman married Sheikh
            Fazilatunnesa (Renu). Together they had two daughters, Sheikh Hasina
            and Sheikh Rehana, and three sons, Sheikh Kamal, Sheikh Jamal and
            Sheikh Russel. ​
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1942</strong> - Sheikh Mujibur Rahman passed Matriculation
            examination from Gopalganj Missionary School. The same year he got
            himself admitted into the Islamia College (currently Maulana Azad
            College), Kolkata. From there he completed his graduation in the
            year 1947.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1943</strong> - In 1943, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was elected
            councillor of All India Muslim League from Bengal. He continued to
            serve admirably in this position till the partition of India in
            1947.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1946</strong> - Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was elected
            uncontested as the General Secretary of Islamia College Students
            Union. During the communal riots of Kolkata known as ‘The Great
            Calcutta Killing’ on August 16, 1946, he engaged himself in
            maintaining peace and communal harmony, saving lives of many a
            member of both Hindu and Muslim communities even at the risk of his
            own life.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1947</strong> - Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman joined
            Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy’s move for a United Independent Bengal as
            a third free state along with India and Pakistan. However, the move
            was aborted and subsequently became the foundations of the Father of
            the Nation’s vision for an independent Bangladesh. Unlike many
            others, he did not rush into East Bengal (Pakistan) immediately
            after Partition, rather stayed over in Calcutta for a few weeks,
            joining Mahatma Gandhi’s Peace Mission along with his political
            mentor Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1948</strong> - Sheikh Mujibur Rahman took admission in the
            Department of Law at the University of Dhaka. He founded the East
            Pakistan Muslim Students’ League, the first opposition student
            organization in Pakistan on January 4. He rose in spontaneous
            protest on February 23 when Chief Minister Khawaja Nazimuddin
            declared in the Constituent Assembly: ‘The people of East Pakistan
            must accept Urdu as their state language.’ Sheikh Mujib immediately
            plunged himself in overt activities to build a strong movement
            against the Muslim League’s resolve to make Urdu the only state
            language of Pakistan. On March 2, a meeting held at Fazlul Huq
            Muslim Hall approved a resolution placed by Sheikh Mujib to form an
            All-Party State Language Action Committee. He was arrested along
            with some political workers on March 11 while they were picketing in
            front of secretariat building in observance of the `State Language
            Bangla Day.’ The student community of the country became restive
            following his arrest. In the face of overpowering student protests,
            the Muslim League government was forced to release Sheikh Mujib and
            other student leaders on March 15.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1952</strong>
            On January 26, the then Prime Minister of Pakistan Khawaja
            Nazimuddin declared at a public meeting in the Paltan Maidan that
            Urdu would be the only state language of Pakistan. While in
            captivity, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman stayed in constant touch with those
            waging the movement to realize Bangla as one of the state languages.
            He issued key directives to make the movement a success even from
            the confines of his prison. On February 16, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman
            started a hunger strike unto death that lasted for 11 days and was
            released on February 27. On February 21, the agitated students came
            out on strike in order to press hard their demand to make Bangla as
            one of the state languages of Pakistan in defiance of the curfew
            enforced by the authorities. Salam, Barkat, Rafiq, Jabbar, Shafiur
            and many others were martyred when the police fired on a rally. In a
            statement released from the jail, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman expressed
            deep sorrow for those who lost their lives and continued protesting
            against the unjust police firing through hunger strike. The same
            year he visited China to attend World Peace Conference, where he
            delivered a resounding speech in Bangla, taking the cause of the
            mother language movement to a global audience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1957</strong> - Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was re-elected as the
            General Secretary of the Party at its council meeting held during
            June 13-14, 1957. ​From June 24 to July 13, he visited China on an
            official tour.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1966</strong> - On February 5, 1966, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman
            presented his historic six-point programme known as the `charter of
            freedom of the Bengali nation’. It drew the roadmap for the
            independence of Bangladesh under the garb of greater autonomy. The
            programme hit hard at the roots of Pakistani colonial rule over the
            Bengalis. In the Council Meeting held during March 18-20, Sheikh
            Mujibur Rahman was elected the President of Awami League. He
            travelled far and wide in order to gain support for his 6-Point
            programme and was arrested 8 times, during the campaign, leading the
            regime to arrest him finally on May 8, 1966. He was imprisoned for
            nearly 3 years during this time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1969</strong> - The Agartala Conspiracy Case resulted in a
            nationwide student movement and mass upsurge demanding the
            withdrawal of the case and the release of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
            With continued pressure from the public, the Ayub Khan government on
            February 22 was forced to withdraw the Agartala Conspiracy Case and
            release Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and others. Afterwards, Sheikh Mujib
            was awarded with the title 'Bangabandhu' at a reception of millions
            of students and masses in a mammoth public meeting organized by
            Central Student Action Committee at the Race Course (now Suhrawardy
            Udyan) on February 23. At a discussion meeting held on December 5 to
            observe the death anniversary of Shaheed Suhrawardy, Bangabandhu
            Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared that henceforth East Pakistan would
            be called Bangladesh.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1970</strong> - Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Awami
            League President, urged his countrymen to elect Awami League
            candidates on the basis of the 6-point demand in the country’s first
            general elections held on December 7 (National Assembly), and
            December 17 (Provincial Assembly), barring few seats in the cyclone
            affected coastal areas in the south. He chose 'boat' as the symbol
            to represent Awami League and the nation's hope. When a million
            people died in a catastrophic cyclone in the coastal areas on
            November 12, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman suspended the election campaign
            and rushed to the affected areas. Awami League achieved absolute
            majority in the general elections on December 7, winning 167
            (including 7 women reserved seats) out of the 169 seats of the
            National Assembly in East Pakistan and 298 seats (including 10 women
            reserved seats) of the 310 seats of the Provincial Assembly of East
            Pakistan.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1975</strong> - Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh
            Mujibur Rahman, the architect of Bangladesh, was assassinated by a
            handful of army renegades as part of a larger national and
            international political conspiracy hatched by anti-liberation forces
            in the pre-dawn hours of August 15. They murdered in cold blood
            every member of his family except his daughters Sheikh Hasina and
            Sheikh Rehana, who by fortune alone were abroad at that time.
            Bangladesh observes August 15 as the National Mourning Day and
            remembers the noblest and the greatest Bengali who ever lived,
            through his spirit, ideology, courage and love for the people of his
            nation.
